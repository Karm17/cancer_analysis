Breast Cancer Prediction App

Project Overview
This project is designed to simplify and streamline the process of analyzing breast cancer data, building predictive models, and sharing insights through an interactive web application. Using Streamlit, we have created a user-friendly app that allows users to explore the dataset, train an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, and make predictions. The project combines data analysis, machine learning, and web app development to demonstrate the workflow of creating and deploying an AI-powered solution.
